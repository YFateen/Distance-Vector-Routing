# Distance Vector Routing

Implemented a version of a distance vector routing protocol that computes efficient paths across a network. This was achieved by maintaining peer and forwarding tables between routers to forward packets on the data plane, periodically advertising routes to neighbors using split horizon and poisoned reverse, and poisoning fallen linkes between neighbors.
